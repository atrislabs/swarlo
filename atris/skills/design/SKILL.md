# atris-design

Part of the Atris policy system. Prevents ai-generated frontend from looking generic.

## Atris Integration

This skill uses the Atris workflow:
1. Check `atris/MAP.md` for existing patterns before building
2. Reference `atris/policies/atris-design.md` for full guidance
3. After building, run `atris review` to validate against this policy

## Quick Reference

**Typography:** avoid inter/roboto/system fonts. pick one distinctive font, use weight extremes (200 vs 800).

**Color:** commit to a palette. dark backgrounds easier to make good. steal from linear.app, vercel.com, raycast.com.

**Layout:** break the hero + 3 cards + footer template. asymmetry is interesting. dramatic whitespace.

**Motion:** one well-timed animation beats ten scattered ones. 200-300ms ease-out. no cursor-following lines, no meteor effects, no buttons that chase the cursor.

**Hover:** make elements feel inviting on hover (brighten, subtle scale). never fade out, shift, or hide content behind hover. hover doesn't exist on mobile.

**Scroll:** never override native scroll. use "peeking" (show a few px of next section) instead of full-screen hero + scroll arrow.

**Hero (H1 test):** must answer in 5 seconds — what is it, who is it for, why care, what's the CTA.

**Assets:** high-res screenshots only. no fake dashboards with primary colors. no decorative non-system emojis.

**Backgrounds:** add depth. gradients, patterns, mesh effects. flat = boring.

**Hierarchy:** 2-3 text levels max. don't mix 5 competing styles.

## Before Shipping Checklist

Run through `atris/policies/atris-design.md` "before shipping" section:
- can you name the aesthetic in 2-3 words?
- distinctive font, not default?
- at least one intentional animation?
- background has depth?
- hover states feel inviting, not confusing?
- scrolling feels native?
- hero passes H1 test (what/who/why/CTA)?
- all assets crisp?
- would a designer clock this as ai-generated?
